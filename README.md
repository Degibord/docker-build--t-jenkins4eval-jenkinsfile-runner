THIS PROJECT IS USING R-MODELING AND TENSORFLOW TO EXTRACT DATA FROM API.  THE OVERALL MODE OF ANALYSIS MODELING WILL BE SUPPORTING 
THE THEORY OF NEURAL NETWORKING.  THE ORGANIC AND DEVELOPMENT FUNCTIONS WILL BE A SUPPORTED ANALYSIS OF PHILOSOPHY, DATA EXPLORATION, 
TWEEKING, ACCURACY, AND CREATIVITY.  THE CREATORS OF THE PROJECT ARE HOPING TO GAIN THE VALUABLE EXPERIENCE OF EXPLORATION. WHILE STAYING 
AWAY FROM A RELIANCE ON PRINCIPLES, BUT STAYING INSIDE OF THE THEME OF TECHNICAL DETERMINISM, IT IS A HOPE OF THE CREATORS OF THE PROJECT
THAT THIS REPOSITORY INCLUDES UNIQUE PREDICTIVE FLOWS AND CREATIVITY PARTNERSHIPS.

IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE IDEAS AND MODELS TRAINED IN THIS REPOSITORY WILL PRODUCE ENOUGH RELEVANCY AND DATA TO EXPOSE NEW ANSWERS TO NEW
QUESTIONS.  THE VIRTUAL WORLD CAN TRANSFORM TO MEET THE PHYSICAL WORLD WITH THE CORRECT FOUNDATIONS AND EXAMINATIONS.  

R-MODEL 1.0 IS A SET OF DATA TO TEST A PREDICTIVE MODEL TITLED: 5 POINT PREDICTIVE MODEL, A.K.A. BEAR, KILLER BEES, DEEP SPACE, HONEY MODEL.
